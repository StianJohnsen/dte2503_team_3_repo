## API Access level
We oriented the API level on the [Google Play's target API level requirement](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk), which suggests **API level 33**. Some features might not work for lower APIs. 

## Login
Because the app is not published to the Google Play Store, the Google login is only available to developers. To try the app out you have to use the regular login.
